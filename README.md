This website was created to sell products to customers.
The website has a variety of products unique to a certain client base.
In the product page, there is my merchandise that ranges from cars and motocycles to sneakers and dress heels.
I also created a custom checkout page for my customers to put their credit card information in to complete their transactions.
There is a register page for clients to become members where they can get discounts on future purchases through alerts in their emails.
